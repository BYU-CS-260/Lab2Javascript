To complete this lab, you will need to create an account at [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org) and [follow the instructions to get an API key](http://openweathermap.org/appid).

Once you have an API key, you can call the API, using the JavaScript fetch() method. **You will need to supply your own API key in every place where these tutorials use APIKEY.**

We're going to do the following in this lab:

* learn how to use the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to [fetch and display current weather conditions](https://github.com/BYU-CS-260-Winter-2019/lab2/wiki/Current-Weather-Conditions)
* learn how to use the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to [fetch and display the weather forecast](https://github.com/BYU-CS-260-Winter-2019/lab2/wiki/Weather-Forecast)
